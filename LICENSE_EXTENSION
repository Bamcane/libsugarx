The UnLock License Extension v2.1

- No Closed Source: I will never privately maintain or re-license this software. This is the only release.
- No Vandalism: I will never delete the repo or inject malicious code, regardless of sponsorship.

This is a moral extension to the main license. It is a statement of intent, not a legal license, and cannot be revoked
